# Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Binary-Classification
### Use a neural network to recognize the hand-written digits zero and one.

- We will use a neural network to recognize two handwritten digits, zero and one.

- This is a binary classification task.

- Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks.
